# NestJS Server-Sent Events

The **NestJS Server-Sent Events** repository is a practical resource that demonstrates the integration of Server-Sent Events (SSE) with NestJS. SSE is a technology that enables real-time communication between a server and a client. This repository provides a straightforward approach to implementing SSE in your NestJS applications.
